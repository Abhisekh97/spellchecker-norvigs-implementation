this is a very basic implementation of Peter Norvig's implementation of spell checker. 
code is not yet cleaned but will clean soon.
there are two files one spell_check_basic file which is training model . shakespear.txt is the data set upon which the training is done. 
you can use your own dataset. and run training file and save voacb and probabilities and then use the spell_correction_project.py file to get corrections. will be working on the advanced algorithms related to sysmpell  to make it faster
